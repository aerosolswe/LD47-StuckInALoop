It might take a few seconds to load because there is a unity bug with the build compression.

### General idea:
Just survive as long as you can while you are tethered to your spaceship

### Art:
By me in photoshop

### Sound fx & music:
Music done in Bosca Ceoil & other sound effects is done by my voice
